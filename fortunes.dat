Hello, world!
Welcome to JFortune.
We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep. --Shakespeare, _The Tempest_
They have computers, and they may have other weapons of mass destruction. (Janet Reno)
Technical people are better off not looking at patents. If somebody sues you, you change the algorithm or you just hire a hit-man to whack the stupid git. (Linus Torvalds)
All parts should go together without forcing. You must remember that the parts you are reassembling were disassembled by you. Therefore, if you can't get them together again, there must be a reason. By all means, do not use a hammer. (1925 IBM Maintenence Manual)
On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog. (Peter Steiner)
Computer Science: 1. A study akin to numerology and astrology, but lacking the precision of the former and the success of the latter. 2. The boring art of coping with a large number of trivialities. (Stan Kelly-Bootle)
Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window. (Steve Wozniak)
Anyone who has attended a USENIX conference in a fancy hotel can tell you that a sentence like "You're one of those computer people, aren't you?" is roughly equivalent to "Look, another amazingly mobile form of slime mold!" in the mouth of a hotel cocktail waitress. (Elizabeth Zwicky)
Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. (Rich Cook)
Those people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do. (Isaac Asimov)
Beware of programmers who carry screwdrivers. (Leonard Brandwein)
    It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter. (Nathaniel S Borenstein)
    Lisp has all the visual appeal of oatmeal with fingernail clippings mixed in. (((Larry Wall)))
Using Java for serious jobs is like trying to take the skin off a rice pudding wearing boxing gloves. (Tel Hudson)
If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, Perl will give you ten bullets and a laser scope, then stand by and cheer you on. (Teodor Zlatanov)
Java is the most distressing thing to happen to computing since MS-DOS. (Alan Kay)
Perl: The only language that looks the same before and after RSA encryption. (Keith Bostic)
C++ is history repeated as tragedy. Java is history repeated as farce. (Scott McKay)
Java, the best argument for Smalltalk since C++. (Frank Winkler
Java is the SUV of programming tools. (Philip Greenspun)
Java: the elegant simplicity of C++ and the blazing speed of Smalltalk. (Jan Steinman)
Anyone could learn Lisp in one day, except that if they already knew Fortran, it would take three days. (Marvin Minsky)
Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been bad: Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++. The good languages have been those that were designed for their own creators: C, Perl, Smalltalk, Lisp. (Paul Graham)
He who hasn't hacked assembly language as a youth has no heart. He who does as an adult has no brain. (John Moore)
I remember being impressed with Ada because you could write an infinite loop without a faked up condition. The idea being that in Ada the typical infinite loop would normally be terminated by detonation. (Larry Wall)
C treats you like a consenting adult. Pascal treats you like a naughty child. Ada treats you like a criminal. (Bruce Powel Douglass)
